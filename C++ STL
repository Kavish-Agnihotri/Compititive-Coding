        1.Sort (TC -  N*logN)
        
                For Array 
                
                        sort(arr,arr+n,mycompare);
        
                For Vector and String
                
                        Accending order - sort(vector.begin(),vector.end());
                        Descending order - sort(vector.begin(),vector.end(),mycompare)
                                           
                                           bool mycompare(T a,T b)
                                           {     return a>b;    }
                                           
                        Partial sort of array and Vector can be done using - 
                                partial_sort(first pos iter, till pos sort,last pos 
                        
                For Linked List
                        
                        Accending order - ListName.sort();
                        Desceding order - ListName.sort(mycompare);
                        
                
                       
             
        2. Search
        
                Binary Search - 
                
                        int binary_search(start address,end address,key);
                                return 1 = key found 
                                return 0 = key not found
                                
                        int lower_bound(start address,end address,key)
                                
                                case 1: if key not exist in array/vector
                                        Returns the pointer to position of next higher number then key . 
                                        If key is greater the (n-1)th num then it returns n
                                 
                                 case 2: If key exist exactly ones 
                                        Return the ptr to position of key 
                                        in vector pos=return value-vector.begin()
                                        
                                 case 3: If key exist multiple times 
                                        Returns the ptr to position of first occurence of key
                                        
                         int upper_bound(start address,end address,key)
                                
                                case 1: if key not exist in array/vector
                                        Returns the position of next higher number then key . 
                                        If key is greater the (n-1)th num then it returns n
                                 
                                 case 2: If key exist exactly ones 
                                        Return the position of next higher number then key 
                                        in vector pos=return value-vector.begin()
              
                                 case 3: If key exist multiple times 
                                        Return pointer to first position of next higher number after last occurrence of num
                                        
3. Non Manupulating Algorithms ( This algo will not make any change in actual vector or data structure )

                I. sort(first pos iterator,last pos iterator)
                II. reverse(first_iterator,last_iterator) - For Array , Vector     mylist.reverse() - For linked list
                III.max_element(first_iterator,last_iterator) - For Array , vector 
                        return the pointer to the maximum element of the array/Vector .
                IV.min_element(first_iterator,last_iterator) 
                        return the pointer to the minimum element of the array/vector .
                V.accumulate(first_iterator,last_iterator,Initial Sum)  - for array and vector
                        return the sum of elements added with Initial Sum 
                VI.count(first_iterator,last_iterator,value)
                        returns the number of times value stored in array / vector
                VII. find(first_iterator,last_iterator,value)
                        return the pointer to the location where element is found
                        if element is not found in vector it points to vecotr.end() i.e. out of vector
                        if element is not found in array it points to n'th location i.e. out of array
                        
4. Manupulative Algorithms ( This algo. will make some changes in array or vector )

        I.vector.erase(position)  only works for vector. Delete element at pos 1 = vector.erase(vector.begin()+1);
        II. vector.erase(position 1,position 2) - Delete from pos 1 to pos 2
        III. vector.erase(unique(v.begin(),v.end(),v.end())  
                This removes the duplicate element given that the vector is sorted . Here unique gives the distinct element
                but does not resize the vector. resize is done by erase call .
        IV. next_permutation(first_iterator,last_iterator)  For finding n! permutation of vector or String .
        V. Prev_permutation(first_iterator,last_iterator)  Can be used to print permutation in reverse .
        vI . distance(first_iterator, Iterator to location) Can be used to find position of value while function return 
                                                           pointer like in max_element,min_element,find.
                                                           
                                                           
5. Some new function which can be used for Array , Vector and String

        I. all_of(first_iterator,last_iterator,comparator)  This function check if every element in array is following some 
                                                            condition like greater then 0 or not .
                  Return True - If every element follow perticular functionality given in comparator
                        else False
                     comparator example - [](int a){ return a<0; }
       
        II. any_of(first_iterator,last_iterator,comparator)
        III. none_of(firsr_iterator,last_iterator,comparator)
        
        IV. copy_n(first_iterator of ar1(array you want to copy), n (no. of element) , first_iterator of ar2(array to which
                                                                                                            copy data
           This function is used to copy data of one array to another array
                                                                                                            
        V. iota(first_iterator,last_iterator,starting value)
            This function initializes the array from staring value in continues like 1,2,3,4,5,6 .
